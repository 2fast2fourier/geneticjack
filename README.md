####experimental genetic algorithm for blackjack optimization

this program attempts to generate an optimized strategy for blackjack,
results in a cross-reference for determining when to hit/stand based on current hand and dealer's revealed card

(optimal blackjack strategy was already been mathmatically proven a while ago, this is just an exercise)

built with go1.4
no external libraries
